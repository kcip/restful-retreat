In just 10 minutes you can be at the heart of the trendy, funky, and bohemian Shimokitazawa that has a smorgasbord of affordable yet mouth-wateringly good restaurants and vintage clothes shops. The house is well situated in between train stations: 5 minutes walk to Ikenoue station on Inokashira line, 3rd stop from Shibuya station. 8 minutes walk to Shimokitazawa station on Odakyu line, 10 minutes from Shimokitazawa to Shinjuku by train. All very convenient!  Also, if you just feel like taking your sweet time to just enjoy the walk and see a beautiful scenery at the same time, there is a very beautiful garden road that will take you to Ikejiri ohashi station on Denentoshi line which is just a 20 minute walk from our home. Amazing park like atmosphere in Kichijoji is nearby too.",

  "neighborhood_overview": "With approaching 40 million in the greater Tokyo area this is the world's big daddy city and can be very confusing. Central Tokyo can be defined as lying within the Yamanote raliway line (an albeit much larger equivalent of Zone 1 London within the Circle Line or within the Peripherique in Paris). We are in the central Minato-ward, which is high end residential, home to many embassies, some of the city's best eating and drinking and key tourist attractions such as Tokyo Tower.  The house is in the Minami Azabu neighbourhood behind the South Korean embassy. The immediate surroundings of the house are very tranquil but the bustling and very popular Azabu Juban shopping street is just 5 mins walk away. This shopping street retains some old world charm while being located right next to Roppongi Hills and other large developments. Up the hill from the house you have the lovely Aruisagawa Park and there are also a number of nearby temples and shrines and the house is well located for Tokyo's",
